Feedback: Recursion was hard to wrap my head around, but the diffuculty makes sense.

Time Took: The time it took was around 7-8 on and off hrs.

Resources: For an idea of recursion, I used zybooks: https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/MSUCSE331OnsaySpring2020
To recursively search a list I used 1)Lecture2_intro_recursion: https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/le/content/911577/viewContent/8487013/View
Looking at slide 18: Search a Linked List.
